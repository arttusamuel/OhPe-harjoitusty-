Program simulates a simple primitive movie reservation system. 

Program has a separate file as a "database" and saves changes locally. UI is only text based and not perfect.

This is one of the first programming projects that I've made.

Certainly this program needs enhancements, but for now it has basic functionality and logic that works as it is.
